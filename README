littleballs.m
	One trial of our Experiment 1 about when people percieve cause-y sorts of
	events.  It is called from superballs.m and all parameters are defined in
	superballs.m.  Only the temporal lag between the first ball's arrival at
	the center of the screen and the second ball's initiation of movement is
	varied among conditions.  Experimental items are those in which the first
	ball touches the second ball before the second ball starts moving.  Fillers
	are those in which the second ball starts off at the opposite end of the 
	screen from the first and then moves to meet the first ball.  Lots of
	parameters can be varied, but those are the ones we're using right now.
	
superballs.m
	The main function for Experiment 1 about when people percieve cause-y sorts
	of events.  It takes as a parameter only the subject number.  It prints
	data from the experiment into a file called data.txt.
	
data.txt
	Multiple rows are added to this file when superballs.m is run.  Each row
	contains the date the experiment was run, the subject number provided to
	the program when it ran, the trial display type (cause == experimental, 
	reverse == filler), the temporal lag for that trial, and whether or not the 
	participant's response indicated that they percieved cause in that trial (+
	means they did percieve cause, - means that they did not percieve cause).
	All subjects' data is stored in the same file.
