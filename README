1. start up an internet connection

2. open matlab

3. navigate to this folder

4. run the following command at the matlab command prompt:

		physalis('<condition letter>', <subject number>)
		
	where condition letter is A, B, C, or D represending which condition
	you want to run this subject on, and the subject number increases for
	each physalis subject run regardless of condition (e.g. the first subject
	for condition B might be input as subject 2 if there was already a 
	subject 1 run on condition A.)
	
	conditions are:
		A - The red ball pushed the blue ball.
		B - The red ball gorped the blue ball.
		C - The red ball and the blue ball touched.
		D - The red ball and the blue ball gorped.

5. that's it!  :)

data will be output to the file "data.txt" where the columns are:
	1 subject Number
	2 condition
	3 trial number
	4 lag in miliseconds
	5 gap in centimeters
	6 response
	7 start time for this participant's experiment
